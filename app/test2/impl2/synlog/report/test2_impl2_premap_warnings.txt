@W: MT531 :"d:\fpga\example\test2\number.v":8:3:8:6|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 14 sequential elements including memo_1_[7].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
